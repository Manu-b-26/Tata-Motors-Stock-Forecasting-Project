## üîç Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Daily stock prices of Tata Motors were collected via [source].

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and transformed data into time series format.

3. **STL Decomposition**  
   - Used to separate trend, seasonality, and residuals.

4. **Stationarity Testing**  
   - ADF test and differencing to achieve stationarity.

5. **ARIMA Modeling**  
   - Identified appropriate (p,d,q) using ACF/PACF plots and AIC criteria.

6. **Residual Diagnostics**  
   - Checked residuals for white noise behavior and model adequacy.

7. **Volatility Modeling (GARCH)**  
   - Fitted a GARCH(1,1) model to capture heteroskedasticity.

## üìä Key Results

- **ARIMA model:** Best fit was ARIMA(p,d,q) = ...
- **Forecast:** 10/30/60-day forecast with 95% CI
- **GARCH model:** Captured periods of high volatility
- **Diagnostics:** Residuals passed Ljung-Box and ARCH tests
